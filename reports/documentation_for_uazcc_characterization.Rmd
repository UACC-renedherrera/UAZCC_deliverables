## Characteristics and Attributes


### Population 


- TOTAL POPULATION
- Survey/Program: American Community Survey
- Universe: Total population
- Year: 2018
- Estimates: 5-Year
- Table ID: B01003


Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation ). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.


While the 2014-2018 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the February 2013 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.


Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.


### Rural 


Calculated Rural / Total.


- URBAN AND RURAL
- Survey/Program: Decennial Census
- Universe: Housing units
- Year: 2010
- Table ID: H2

When information is missing or inconsistent, the Census Bureau logically assigns an acceptable value using the response to a related question or questions. If a logical assignment is not possible, data are filled using a statistical process called allocation, which uses a similar individual or household to provide a donor value. The "Allocated" section is the number of respondents who received an allocated value for a particular subject.


The age dependency ratio is derived by dividing the combined under-18 and 65-and-over populations by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100.


The old-age dependency ratio is derived by dividing the population 65 and over by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100.


The child dependency ratio is derived by dividing the population under 18 by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100.

#### Non-Hispanic White 


Start with the population **Not-Hispanic or Latino** then choose sub-population **White alone**.


> White – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.

Select total population of **Hispanic or Latino and Race**


> Hispanics may be of any race, so also are included in applicable race categories. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.

Geographic areas are based on the geographic boundaries of the data year. Current year comparisons with past-year estimates are not re-tabulated to the current year's geographies; rather, the comparison is with the existing geography of each data year. Statistically significant change from prior years' estimates could be the result of changes in the geographic boundaries of an area and not necessarily the demographic, social, or economic characteristics. For more information on geographic changes, see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html .


Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error.

In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation ). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.


Since the 5-year data do not benefit from data quality filtering, comparisons are only made for populations of 5,000 or more.


The definitions of the metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas for the 2013 American Community Survey are based on the commuting patterns identified in the 2010 Census. Estimates prior to 2013 are based on the results of the 2000 Census. Statistically significant change from prior years' estimates could be the result of changes in the metropolitan geographic definitions and not necessarily the demographic, social or economic characteristic. For more information, see: Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas .


Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. For guidance on differences in employment and unemployment estimates from different sources go to Labor Force Guidance .


Workers include members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work last week.


Industry codes are 4-digit codes and are based on the North American Industry Classification System 2017. The Industry categories adhere to the guidelines issued in Clarification Memorandum No. 2, "NAICS Alternate Aggregation Structure for Use By U.S. Statistical Agencies," issued by the Office of Management and Budget.


Census occupation codes for 2018 are based on the 2018 revision of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). Occupation data from 2018 are not strictly comparable to data from 2017 or prior. For more information on the Census occupation code changes, please visit our website at https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html .


Logical coverage edits applying a rules-based assignment of Medicaid, Medicare and military health coverage were added as of 2009 -- please see https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/coverage_edits_final.html for more details. The 2008 data table in American FactFinder does not incorporate these edits. Therefore, the estimates that appear in these tables are not comparable to the estimates in the 2009 and later tables. Select geographies of 2008 data comparable to the 2009 and later tables are available at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run-health-insurance.html . The health insurance coverage category names were modified in 2010. See https://www.census.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_18 for a list of the insurance type definitions.


Beginning in 2017, selected variable categories were updated, including age-categories, income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories, and the age universe for certain employment and education variables. See user note entitled "Health Insurance Table Updates" for further details.


While the 2014-2018 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the February 2013 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.
